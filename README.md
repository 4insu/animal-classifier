# Animal Classifier

Welcome to the Animal Classifier repository! This project is aimed at classifying over 90 different animal species using transfer learning with the EfficientNetB3 model.

## Overview

This project utilizes transfer learning, leveraging the pre-trained EfficientNetB3 model to classify various animal species accurately. The EfficientNetB3 model is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises images of over 90 different animal species. It has been carefully curated and labeled to ensure accurate classification. Due to the diverse nature of the dataset, the model is capable of recognizing a wide range of animal species.

## Model

EfficientNetB3, a convolutional neural network architecture, serves as the backbone for this animal classifier. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune the model on the specific task of classifying animal species. By reusing the pre-trained weights and adjusting the final layers, the model achieves high accuracy even with a relatively small dataset.

## Usage

To utilize the animal classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone # Animal Classifier using EfficientNetB3
